                  The Real-Time Traffic Monitoring project monitors traffic flow in Southern California, 
                  providing a system that collects and streams traffic data, detects and classifies vehicles, 
                  and generates data statistics which describe traffic flow, all in real time. With technologies
                  like LiDAR sensing and machine learning, this system is intended to be an application of 
                  intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in Californiaâ€™s major metropolitan areas.

                  Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have become increasingly 
                  important to the development of smarter and safer transportation infrastructure, 
                  especially in Southern California, where traffic continues to be a severe 
                  and chronic problem. Vehicle detection technologies greatly support the 
                  applications of ITS, providing information such as the number of vehicles
                  in traffic, number of vehicle types, or density of vehicles in each lane. 
                  This is done through LiDAR data that can provide
                  valuable info that traditional radar or video sensors can't.

                  The creation of our website was done with the help of React libraries! Some that were used were
                  Bootstrap to customize and organize the pages on the website as well as the components on the site. 
                  AWS SDK was used to be able to create a connection between the website and the AWS system. ECharts 
                  was used to display real-time data statistics on the website. ReactHLSPlayer was used to be able 
                  to display the real-time 2D Video on the website.

                  Velodyne Ultra Puck helped capture a 3D scan of the environment in the form of 
                  point clouds in real time. The Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i helped with 2D data collection, 
                  displaying video and depth metrics, though we mainly used the camera solely for streaming 
                  without the metrics.

                  vehicle detection. LabelImg was used to take relevant images and manually apply bounding 
                  boxes for the sake of training the model to accommodate the project. Google Colab was 
                  used as a cloud-hosted version of Jupyter Notebook used to train the custom dataset and 
                  run the model with the aforementioned dataset.
