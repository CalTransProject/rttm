              The Real-Time Traffic Monitoring project monitors traffic flow in Southern California, 
              providing a system that collects and streams traffic data, detects and classifies vehicles, 
              and generates data statistics which describe traffic flow, all in real time. With technologies
               like LiDAR sensing and machine learning, this system is intended to be an application of 
               intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in Californiaâ€™s major metropolitan areas.

              <p className="techPR">
              Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have become increasingly 
              important to the development of smarter and safer transportation infrastructure, 
              especially in Southern California, where traffic continues to be a severe 
              and chronic problem. Vehicle detection technologies greatly support the 
              applications of ITS, providing information such as the number of vehicles
               in traffic, number of vehicle types, or density of vehicles in each lane. 
               This is done through LiDAR data that can provide
                valuable info that traditional radar or video s ensors can't.

              The creation of our website was done with the help of React libraries! Some that were used were
               Bootstrap to customize and organize the pages on the website as well as the components on the site. 
               AWS sdk was used to be able to create a connection between the website and the AWS system. ECharts 
               was used to display real time data statistics on the website. ReactHLSPlayer was used to be able 
               to display the real time 2D Video on the website.

              When it came to data acquisition it all happened thanks to the help of two devices. The 
              Velodyne Ultra Puck helped capture a 3D scan of the environment in the form of 
              point clouds in real time. The Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i helped with 2D data collection, 
              displaying video and depth metrics, thought we mainly used the camera soley for streaming 
              without the metrics.

              vehicle detection. LabelImg was used to take relevant images and manually apply bounding 
              boxes for the sake of training the model to accommodate the project. Google Colab was 
              used as a cloud hosted version of Jupyter Notebook used to train the custom dataset and 
              run the model with the aforementioned dataset.
