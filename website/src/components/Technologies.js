                Vehicle detection plays an important role in analyzing the traffic flow data for intelligent transportation planning. 
                This project monitors the real-time traffic flow of the highway using a LiDAR camera and stereo-based depth camera to 
                collect real-time traffic data, process it for vehicle detection, and develop a web-based service with real-time vehicle 
                detection stream and statistical data visualization.This project is composed of 4 modules: Data acquisition, 2D vehicle detection,
                3D vehicle detection, and web application. The data acquisition module collects traffic flow data from the 2D camera and 3D LiDAR camera, 
                after which the data is annotated and labeled. After training and testing, the 2D and 3D machine learning models will be integrated into 
                the real-time web application for detection and classifications of vehicles in real-time traffic flow. The real-time video with recognized vehicles 
                labeled in the video will be displayed in the web-based user interface. In addition, real-time traffic flow statistic data extracted from the 3D vehicle 
                detection results will be visualized on the web-based user interface.
