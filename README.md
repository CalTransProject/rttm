# RTTM v0.2.2
Github repo for Real-Time Traffic Monitoring project! This branch may not contain all of the expected features. A complete build of the website will be pushed onto the main branch. This branch will focus on the developmental and testing phases of the web application.

## Whats New in Version 0.2.2?
Various changes were made to the entire website! An npm re-install may be necessary to be able to view the site properly.

Changes were made to the Main Page
> The main page has been worked on currently displaying the text box and a AWS Video Player. The video player is functional for purposes with IVS but is non-functional for purposes needed for this project due to a change with the system in charge of gathering and handling the video.

Changes and fixes were done to the Header & Footer
> The header and footers have been adjusted to be able to fix a bug that prevented it from covering the entire width of the browser window. In the footer, links were added to replace the buttons that were initially added.

Other Changes and Known Issues
> A gradient background was added. It currently doesn't fill up the entire height of the window screen when not enough content is added to the page. The base foundation was implemented to be able to use React Router v6 and add more pages to the website.

## Build
In order to run these files properly, [NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction) must be installed on the system.
